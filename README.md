My first assignemnt while enrolled in the UCF Full Stack Web Development Boot Camp.  This app 
allows users to add quotes that will be randomly displayed in the main page. A database-powered quote generator with a monile-first design, using the Ruby on Rails framework, HTML, and CSS. Uses Git and GitHub for version control, and launched on Heroku.
